    <p>One of the things I miss the most about New York City is central park. Every weekend I would wake up early to go jogging along the big loop, which is about 6 miles long. The trail is for the most part surrounded by tall trees which hide most of the buildings from sight; it is one of the few places in NYC that you can go to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and feel more connected to nature.
