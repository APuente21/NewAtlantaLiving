    <p>I wish I could tell you that I was saddened when the day to leave New York City finally arrived. I mean, who doesn't love being woken up in the middle of the night because their neighbors phone was vibrating? Or being stucked in the subway for over forty minutes because a car had somehow been swept onto the train tracks? Doesn't everyone like paying $3k, a month, for a 500 sqr ft apartment on a forth floor walk up with no amenities? Needless to say, I was pretty darn static when the day of the move finally arrived.
