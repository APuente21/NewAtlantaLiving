                <p>One of the things I miss the most about New York City is central park. Every weekend I would wake up early to go jogging along the big loop, which is about 6 miles long. The trail is for the most part surrounded by tall trees which hide most of the buildings from sight; it is one of the few places in NYC that you can go to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and feel more connected to nature. Not only is the loop very picturesque, but its paved roads provide an ideal place for jogging and biking. Since moving to Atlanta we've visited a lot of parks, but none of them had a large enough trail that would inspire me to pick up running again, that is until I discovered the Silver Comet Trail.<br><br>
                The Silver Comet Trail starts at the Mavell Road Trailhead in Smyrna, Georgia, and ends at the Georgia/Alabama state line. I can't tell you what the entire trail is like, as I have only biked 6.3 miles (out of 61.5 miles), but what I have seen has been quite stunning. The trail is surrounded by trees, which in many places block out the sun. The fact that there is so much shade means that we could enjoy our bike ride, even though it was 85 degrees, sunny, and humid. The trail itself is not very wide, it only has two lanes, so we did have to maneuver around people who were walking/running on the road. In addition, we didn't see too many rest stops where you could refill your water bottler- the only place we found was about 1.5/2 miles into the trail, before crossing one of the bridges, there was a trail on the right that lead uphill, which lead to a rest area where you could go to the bathroom and refill your water bottle at a small fountain they had outside. One of the things that the trail does have are benches, which were conveniently located along the trail, which meant that when our butts got sore from all the bike riding, and they did get sore, we could get off for a little bit, sit down, and enjoy the view. <br><br>
                As I mentioned before, the trail is great for running and biking. If you are thinking of visiting the trail, and you haven't been there before I would recommend you bike, as it would allow you to see a lot of the trail the first time around. If you don't have a bike, you can always rent a bike. We often rent our bikes from a place called Smyrna Bikes, they are located at the very beginning of the trail, and even provide you with a helmet- they charge you per hour. There is also another bike rental shop that we saw along our bike ride, it was about 4/5 miles into the trail; I can't really say how good it is as I have never rented a bike from there, but I assume it's popular given the people that we saw congregated around it. <br><br>
                    Overall, I love the trail. If you are looking for a place where you can do some long distance running or biking, this is the place to visit.
