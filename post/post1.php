                <h2>Our Move to Atlanta</h2>

                <p>I wish I could tell you that I was saddened when the day to leave New York City finally arrived. I mean, who doesn't love being woken up in the middle of the night because their neighbors phone was vibrating? Or being stucked in the subway for over forty minutes because a car had somehow been swept onto the train tracks? Doesn't everyone like paying $3k, a month, for a 500 sqr ft apartment on a fourth floor walk up with no amenities? Needless to say, I was pretty darn static when the day of the move finally arrived. <br/><br/>
                Sure, there are many things that I will miss about NYC; this is the city where I first fell in love, the city where I met my husband, and the city where I got married. Not to mention that most of my family and friends all live here. This is the city where I was born, and as far as my family is concerned, this is the city where I should live out the rest of my existence. And yes, for many years this is what I had envisioned for myself, I had fooled myself into thinking that I could never be happy anywhere else and that this is where I stood the best chance of advansing in my career. Needless to say, I don't feel this way anymore. Don't get me wrong, I love NYC and I believe that it has a lot of great things to offer. But, over the years I have also come to see it for what it really is, a trap. You are expected to work long hours for a paycheck that was completely goobled up by your rental/mortgage expenses, and yet you are told it's all worth it because of the cultural opportunites that NY has to offer. I mean, does wanting an offordable house close to the city make me greedy? I certainly don't think so.<br/><br/>
                So, I'm packing my bags, putting my cats in their crates, and moving down to Atlanta. Wish me luck boys and girls, as my husband and I embark on this new adventure.
