                <h2>About Andres and Petr</h2>
                <p><img src="../img/newMe.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width: 60%; height: 30%;" alt="me">My husband often jokes at how domesticated I've become, after all, it's not every day you find a guy in his 30s that likes crocheting, gardening, cooking, and cleaning (I don't really enjoy cleaning but my husband likes to reinforce the idea in the hopes that I might develop a liking for it - it's not happening). In addition to the items mentioned above, I also love traveling to new places and reading a good fantasy/fiction book, as well as learning new languages- I'm currently learning Japanese. Music is also very important to me. When I was a child music helped me drown out the noise from all my relatives, and as an adult it helps focus my thoughts.  <br/><br/>
                My husband and I just moved from New York City to Atlanta, thanks to a great job opportunity that was presented to my husband. Neither of us ever saw ourselves living in Atlanta- not that there is anything wrong with the city, we love it here, but for a long time we couldn't imagine living anywhere but NYC, a feeling I'm sure most New Yorkers share. To help motivate us to explore more of Atlanta, I decided to create this blog so that I may document our adventures in this great city. So, stay tuned and join us as we discover Atlanta. If you have any suggestions of things to do or places to visit, please feel free to drop me an email at andres@andrespuente.us
